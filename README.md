This repository is about Udacity DataAnalyst Nano Degree projects.

# Project1 - Global Weather Trend Analysis
In this project, I have analysed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends with where I live to overall global 
temperatures.

# Project2 - Investigate_TMDb_Movie_Dataset
In this project, I have investigated and analyzed the TMDb movie dataset. This dataset contains The TMDb Movie data set contains data
for 10,000 movies from the movie database(TMDb), inluding user ratings and revenue. In this project I mainly did Exploratory analysis
to answer research questions such as top rated movies, top budgeted movies, most prefered actor etc.

# Project3 - A_B_Test Analysis
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.  It is important that you get some practice working with
the difficulties of these 

For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.  My goal 
was to work through this to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or 
perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision. 

# Project4 - Data Wrangling

The dataset that I had worked for wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. 
WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. 
The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers 
and has received international media coverage.

My goal: Wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. The Twitter archive is great, but it only contains 
very basic tweet information. Additional gathering, then assessing and cleaning is required for "Wow!"-worthy analyses and visualizations.

Output: The output files are shown in the above files shared with all the visuals and major insights.

# Project5 - ProsperLoan Data Visualization

This dataset contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income and many others.
This data dictionary explains the variables in the data set. This project objective is not expected to explore all of 
the variables in the dataset. But focus on only exploration on about 10 to 15 of them.
